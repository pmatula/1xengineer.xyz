# 1xengineer.xyz

This repo is the source of [1xengineer.xyz](http://1xengineer.xyz/), a website illustrating what a 1x engineer _really_ is.

Full credit goes to the original website: [1x.engineer](https://1x.engineer).

The motivation for this project is to provide a maintained version with modern themes.

## Contributing

Want to help contribute to 1xengineer.xyz? Cool! Feel free to PR whatever you think is appropriate and fitting with the theme, as long as your contributions are in-line with the project's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### New Traits

Feel free to add new traits of 1x developers. We generally try to keep traits free of blame, and be sure not to exclude 1x developers in the phrasing or intent of the traits.

### Editing Traits

If there are refinements that can be made to existing traits to make them more accurate or inclusive of 1x developers, please feel free to make them - your contributions are more than welcome.

Additionally, if you feel that a trait doesn't represent 1x developers, please feel free to remove it and share why. This project goes both ways.

### New Themes

Feel free to add new themes of 1x developers. Please keep in mind that the new theme should work without classes.
